# To Do: 

- Need to add validations to everything. 

- Build out some type of sub-authentication against "Tenants", they can only view "Issues" and other basic informaiton. These profiles are created when landlords set up a tenant automatically. 

- Need a "show" for my issues page. 

- Need to add a "Notes" for my issues page, this way people can keep track of issues above just "status" as well, this is where I think I will have the text messaging functionality live, possibly as "Notes" against an issue. 

- Need a way to show / hide items based on thier status. For example I need to hide "issues" that are marked as "complete"

- Need to update "status" against tenats and against "properties" to do something helpful. 

- Do I want to try to manage rent? I might just want to remove this functionality alltogether.
